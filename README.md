# Pipeline taking you from aligned BAM files to PCA and Manhattan plots for variant discovery

## Illumina paired end sequencing was used to create the files

## These files were aligned using BWA-mem

## They were trimmed using fastp 

## This pipeline should take you from the alignment step all the way to variant discovery
